# The wonderful world of Docker!

Tutorial: 
[Docker's Official Introduction](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
Only do parts 1 & 2 (orientation and containers) and stop at **Share your image** section of part 2.
This will run through the very basics of Docker.

Video:
[VMWare: What is a container?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnJ7qX9fkcU&t=45s)
More of a conceptual than specific video, but really good explanation. Even if you're not a video
person, I recommend watching this.

Tutorial:
[Dockerizing a NodeJS web app](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/)
Another simple tutorial, good quality.
